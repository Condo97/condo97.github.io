## Notable Projects

#### StudyAI Learn With GPT - Swift, SwiftUI, Java, MySQL, Google Analytics, Tenjin (_2021 - Present_)

Over 20k+ lines of code over client + server, utilizing multiple of my and others’ open source frameworks, this app mediates back-and-forth text and image chats with GPT. The server pieces together conversations, verifies in-app purchase transactions, and coordinates GPT completion models. The client uses the latest APIs and tech to provide the user with a clean, functional, and fast user experience.

#### ChefApp AI Recipe Maker - Swift, SwiftUI, Java, MySQL, Google Analytics, Tenjin (_2022 - Present_)
  
Create tasty recipes from a picture of your fridge. Using GPT+Vision and my open source GPT+Function Calling library, this app generates infinitely scrolling recipes from the user’s ingredients. The server uses 5+ GPT functions to generate a recipe, instructions, calorie count, and more for a given input.

#### Java GPT Client (_2022 - Present_) 

Easy to use GPT client coded in Java. Easy to create JSON structured outputs and fill Java objects with GPT generated data. This is used in all of my GPT apps' servers and is actively maintained.

## Work Experience

#### AI+CODE - Swift, SwiftUI, Java, Python, MySQL, ChatGPT, GPT Function Calling (_2024 - Present_)

Multi-file AI code planning and creation. Process uses GPT function calling to queue tasks and edit multiple files across directories. Built on my open source GPT+Function Calling library, AI+CODE is able to handle complex tasks and refactor tough projects.

#### AI+Vision - Swift, SwiftUI, Java, MySQL, Google Analytics, Tenjin (_2023_) 

This project was a challenge to build an app + server in 7 days using my open source libraries and existing modular code. Developing this led to greater experience in SwiftUI structure and new AI camera control modules that I applied to other projects.

#### Barback AI Drink Maker  - Swift, SwiftUI, Java, MySQL, Google Analytics, Tenjin (_2023_)

This project was a challenge to finish an iOS app + server in 30 days using open source frameworks I’ve developed. The server creates drink recipes from the given input. The client collects the user’s bar items and preferences and makes drinks on-demand.
