## Notable Projects

**StudyAI Learn With GPT** - Swift, SwiftUI, Java, MySQL, Google Analytics, Tenjin (_2021 - Present_)

Over 20k+ lines of code over client + server, utilizing multiple of my and others’ open source frameworks, this app mediates back-and-forth text and image chats with GPT. The server pieces together conversations, verifies in-app purchase transactions, and coordinates GPT completion models. The client uses the latest APIs and tech to provide the user with a clean, functional, and fast user experience.

**ChefApp AI Recipe Maker** - Swift, SwiftUI, Java, MySQL, Google Analytics, Tenjin (_2022 - Present_)
  
Create tasty recipes from a picture of your fridge. Using GPT+Vision and my open source GPT+Function Calling library, this app generates infinitely scrolling recipes from the user’s ingredients. The server uses 5+ GPT functions to generate a recipe, instructions, calorie count, and more for a given input.

## Work Experience

**GreenSky, Software Developer** - Swift, Objective-C, Jira, Git (_2017 - 2019_)

Returning to Greensky, a financial technology company, I had a leadership role in upgrading the company’s app from Objective-C to Swift and updating the UI for variable sized devices. I worked with my leader and executives to get the changes approved, held meetings with team members to discuss goals and progress, and worked with QA and testing to publish the changes in production. In this role I held a few release meetings as well.

**GreenSky, Software Development Intern** - Swift, Objective-C, Jira, Git (_2017_)

My first corporate experience, I worked with the team on implementing PDF417 ID scanning to the app to easily input customers information for them to be approved for a loan. Here I learned the structure of the company and procedures created by seniors. I learned how to host my own meetings and create procedure documents. I enjoyed this position because of the learning in code and leadership roles.

## Other Projects

**AI+CODE** - Swift, SwiftUI, Java, Python, MySQL, ChatGPT, GPT Function Calling (_2024 - Present_)

Multi-file AI code planning and creation. Process uses GPT function calling to queue tasks and edit multiple files across directories. Built on my open source GPT+Function Calling library, AI+CODE is able to handle complex tasks and refactor tough projects.

**AI+Vision** - Swift, SwiftUI, Java, MySQL, Google Analytics, Tenjin (_2023_) 

This project was a challenge to build an app + server in 7 days using my open source libraries and existing modular code. Developing this led to greater experience in SwiftUI structure and new AI camera control modules that I applied to other projects.

**Barback AI Drink Maker**  - Swift, SwiftUI, Java, MySQL, Google Analytics, Tenjin (_2023_)

This project was a challenge to finish an iOS app + server in 30 days using open source frameworks I’ve developed. The server creates drink recipes from the given input. The client collects the user’s bar items and preferences and makes drinks on-demand.
