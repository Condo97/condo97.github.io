üëπ EVIL BUNNY AUTO-SPAWNER SYSTEM:
==================================

Automatically spawns 5 evil bunnies at server startup on blocks tagged with "evilBunnySpawner"

üèóÔ∏è SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
======================

1. **Create Spawn Points:**
   ‚Ä¢ Place any part/block in your workspace where you want evil bunnies to spawn
   ‚Ä¢ Can be any size, shape, or material
   ‚Ä¢ Recommended: Use distinctive blocks so you can identify spawn points

2. **Tag the Spawn Points:**
   ‚Ä¢ Select your spawn block in Studio
   ‚Ä¢ In the Properties panel, find the "Tags" section
   ‚Ä¢ Add the tag: evilBunnySpawner
   ‚Ä¢ The tag is case-sensitive!

3. **Automatic Spawning:**
   ‚Ä¢ When the server starts, the system will find all tagged blocks
   ‚Ä¢ 5 evil bunnies will spawn above each spawn point
   ‚Ä¢ Bunnies are arranged in a circle pattern around the spawn point
   ‚Ä¢ 40% chance each bunny will be infected

‚öôÔ∏è CONFIGURATION:
=================

You can modify these settings in EvilBunnyAutoSpawner.server.luau:

‚Ä¢ EVIL_BUNNIES_PER_SPAWNER = 5     -- How many bunnies per spawn point
‚Ä¢ SPAWN_HEIGHT_OFFSET = 5          -- How high above the block to spawn
‚Ä¢ SPAWN_DELAY = 0.5                -- Delay between each bunny spawn
‚Ä¢ INFECTION_CHANCE = 0.4           -- Chance for bunnies to be infected (40%)

üìç SPAWN BEHAVIOR:
==================

‚Ä¢ Bunnies spawn 5 units above the tagged block
‚Ä¢ Arranged in a circle pattern (radius: 3 units)
‚Ä¢ Each gets random infection status based on INFECTION_CHANCE
‚Ä¢ Includes AI movement script and TurnOnDeath transformation
‚Ä¢ All standard bunny counter tracking applies

üîÑ DYNAMIC SPAWNING:
===================

‚Ä¢ If you add new tagged blocks during runtime, they will automatically spawn evil bunnies
‚Ä¢ No need to restart the server
‚Ä¢ Perfect for dynamic gameplay where new spawn points appear

üìä MONITORING:
==============

The system provides detailed logging:
‚Ä¢ Lists all found spawn points on startup
‚Ä¢ Shows spawning progress for each point
‚Ä¢ Reports total evil bunnies spawned
‚Ä¢ Warns if no spawn points are found

Example output:
```
üî• ====== EVIL BUNNY AUTO-SPAWNER INITIALIZED ======
üìç Found 2 evil bunny spawn points:
   1 - Workspace.EvilSpawner1
   2 - Workspace.EvilSpawner2
üëπ Spawning 5 evil bunnies at: EvilSpawner1
‚úÖ Spawned evil bunny 1 at (10, 15, 5) (infected)
‚úÖ Spawned evil bunny 2 at (13, 15, 5) (healthy)
üèÅ Evil bunny spawning complete!
üëπ Total evil bunnies spawned: 10
```

‚ö†Ô∏è  TROUBLESHOOTING:
====================

**No bunnies spawning?**
‚Ä¢ Check that your block has the exact tag: "evilBunnySpawner" (case-sensitive)
‚Ä¢ Ensure the block is in Workspace (not ServerStorage/ReplicatedStorage)
‚Ä¢ Check the server console for error messages

**Bunnies spawning in wrong place?**
‚Ä¢ Make sure your spawn block is positioned where you want them
‚Ä¢ Bunnies spawn 5 units above the block's center
‚Ä¢ Adjust SPAWN_HEIGHT_OFFSET if needed

**Want different spawn amounts?**
‚Ä¢ Change EVIL_BUNNIES_PER_SPAWNER in the script
‚Ä¢ Remember: more bunnies = more server load

üí° BEST PRACTICES:
==================

‚Ä¢ Use clearly labeled spawn blocks (name them "EvilSpawner1", "EvilSpawner2", etc.)
‚Ä¢ Don't place spawn points too close together (bunnies might overlap)
‚Ä¢ Consider placing spawn points away from player spawn areas
‚Ä¢ Test with a few spawn points before adding many

üéÆ GAMEPLAY TIPS:
=================

‚Ä¢ Evil bunnies will start their AI movement immediately after spawning
‚Ä¢ They may move away from spawn points quickly
‚Ä¢ Remember: evil bunnies transform into normal bunnies when killed
‚Ä¢ Great for creating "evil bunny lairs" or "corruption zones"
